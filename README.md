# Hi there 👋 Welcome to my profile!

## A Few Things About Me

- 💻 **Self-taught Software Engineer** 📍  
  I’m passionate about building things that live on the internet, and I’ve learned everything I know through curiosity, coffee, and countless hours of debugging.  

- 🕸️ **Blockchain Enthusiast**  
  I’m obsessed with Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Sui, and Cardano. If it’s decentralized, I’m probably geeking out over it.  

- 🤝 **Community Lover**  
  I thrive on meeting like-minded people who share my passion for tech, blockchain, and memes. Let’s build something awesome together!  

- ⚽ **Football Fanatic**  
  When I’m not coding, you’ll find me playing or watching football. Messi or Ronaldo? Let’s debate!  

- 🤓 **Tech Junkie**  
  I’m always excited to learn new technologies and frameworks. If it’s shiny and new, I’m already Googling it.
